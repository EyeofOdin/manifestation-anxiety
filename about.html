<h1>About</h1>

<p>
This site was written for people who tried sincerely and were told the failure was theirs.
</p>

<p>
It exists because many explanations around manifestation and positive thinking ignore how anxiety and the nervous system actually work, and place responsibility on individuals when the model itself does not apply.
</p>

<p>
Nothing here is meant to motivate, optimise, or fix you. It is meant to explain what happened so that pressure can stop and self-blame can dissolve.
