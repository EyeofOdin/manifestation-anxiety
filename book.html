<h1>Why Manifestation Made My Anxiety Worse</h1>
<h2>And Why It Is Not Your Fault</h2>

<p>
This is a short, focused book written for people who genuinely tried manifestation, positive thinking, or spiritual discipline and ended up feeling worse.
</p>

<p>
More anxious.  
More tense.  
More afraid of their own thoughts.  
More convinced they were doing something wrong.
</p>

<p>
This book explains why that happens.
</p>

<p>
It does not offer techniques, routines, affirmations, visualisations, or mindset hacks. It does not promise outcomes or relief. It does not tell you to try harder or think differently.
</p>

<p>
It explains what actually happens when manifestation practices are applied to an already anxious or overactivated nervous system, and why effort and control often intensify anxiety instead of resolving it.
</p>

<h3>This book is for you if:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Manifestation or positive thinking increased your anxiety</li>
  <li>You felt constant pressure to monitor your thoughts or emotions</li>
  <li>You were told to “let go” but could not</li>
  <li>You started blaming yourself for not getting results</li>
</ul>

<h3>This book is not for you if:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>You are looking for techniques or step-by-step methods</li>
  <li>You want guarantees, promises, or motivation</li>
  <li>You believe effort alone fixes anxiety</li>
</ul>

<p>
This book exists to remove shame, not to sell hope.
